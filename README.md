# When Markdown meets Zotero


Zotermite is an open-source app aimed at facilitating the use of academic references in markdown documents.

Does the previous sentence sound like a foreign language to your kind ears ? Well, then first check out what is Zotero and what is Markdown.

Zotermite can be used to generate markdown bibliographies, but also reading notes templates (the purpose for which I made it in the first place), and whatever your shiny imagination can produce.

Contributions are welcome, especially for the writing of additional standard templates. Send me a mail or pull-request the github for that !
