  <h2>When Markdown meets Zotero</h2>
  <p>Zotermite is an open-source app aimed at facilitating the use of academic references in markdown documents.</p>
  <p>Does the previous sentence sound like a foreign language to your kind ears ? Well, then first check out what is Zotero and what is Markdown.</p>
  <p>Zotermite can be used to generate markdown bibliographies, but also reading notes templates (the purpose for which I made it in the first place), and whatever your shiny imagination can produce.</p>
  <!-- <p>Developpers and digital humanists, please note that Zotermite proposes also a REST API service that you can use programmatically (check out the github for that).</p> -->
  <p>Contributions are welcome, especially for the writing of additional standard templates. Send me a mail or pull-request the github for that !</p>
