  <h2>When Markdown meets Zotero</h2>

  <p>Zotermite is an open-source app aimed at facilitating the use of academic references in markdown documents.</p>

  <p>Does the previous sentence sound like a foreign language to your kind ears ? Well, then first check out <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">what is Zotero</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/" target="_blank"></a>what is Markdown.</p>

  <p>Zotermite can be used to generate markdown bibliographies, but also reading notes templates (the purpose for which I made it in the first place), and whatever your shiny imagination can produce.</p>
  <!-- <p>Developpers and digital humanists, please note that Zotermite proposes also a REST API service that you can use programmatically (check out the github for that).</p> -->
  <p>Contributions are welcome, especially for the writing of additional standard templates. Send me a mail or pull-request the <a href="https://github.com/robindemourat/zotermite/" target="_blank">Github repository</a> for that !</p>
